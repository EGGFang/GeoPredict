Geolocation recognition is an important and challenging research field whose core objective is to determine the geographic coordinates of a photo based on its visual content. This technology plays a crucial role in various applications, such as location tagging on social media, automated threat monitoring in counterterrorism systems, and remote sensing in geographic surveys. With the continuous advancement of deep learning and computer vision technologies, the accuracy and efficiency of geolocation recognition have significantly improved. In particular, the development of large-scale geotagged datasets, such as YFCC100M, has enabled models to learn rich geographic features. Additionally, many methods employ multi-scale partitioning techniques to divide the Earth's surface into finer segments and integrate deep learning models to further enhance geolocation recognition accuracy. However, traditional methods often rely on extensive computational resources and large training datasets, posing challenges to their widespread application and cost-effectiveness.

This study aims to design a geolocation recognition model based on Multi-task Learning (MTL) that enhances the modelâ€™s understanding of scene categories by learning image content labels, thereby improving the accuracy of geographic location predictions. We plan to use a subset of the YFCC100M dataset as the training foundation, integrating scene labels and geographic features to enable the model to make predictions across different scales of geographic regions. Additionally, we will adopt a hierarchical partitioning approach, allowing a single image to represent its distribution at multiple regional scales. Ultimately, we hope to demonstrate that even with a smaller training dataset and limited model resources, the combination of multi-task learning and innovative methods can achieve breakthroughs in accuracy and efficiency for large-scale geolocation prediction while enhancing the applicability and reliability of the technology.
